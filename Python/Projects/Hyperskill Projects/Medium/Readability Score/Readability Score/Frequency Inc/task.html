<p>Let's add one more formula to measure readability, that is, the <strong>SMOG Index</strong>. It stands for Simple Measure of Gobbledygook. The formula is shown below. You can find out more in the <a href="https://readabilityformulas.com/smog-readability-formula.php" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">article</a> by Readability Formulas. Use the table from Stage 3 to calculate the age bracket.</p>
<p><span class="math-tex">\(score = 1.043 * \sqrt{polysyllables \ * \ 30 \over sentences} + 3.1291\)</span></p>
<p>Now you know different formulas to find the readability score. However, none of them takes into account one of the most important metrics — the word frequency. Let's fix it!</p>
<p>In 1948, Edgar Dale and Jeanne Chall invented a formula that determines how difficult a text is according to the number of words that are, most likely, unknown to readers. The formulas we referred to earlier based the score on the number of words and sentences only. Our new formula looks like this: </p>
<p><span class="math-tex">\(score = 0.1579 * {difficult \ words \over words} * 100 + 0.0496 * {words \over sentences}\)</span></p>
<p>If the amount of difficult words is less than 5%, the score does not need any adjustment. Otherwise, you need to add 3.6365 to the score. If you are interested, you can learn more about this formula on the <a href="https://readabilityformulas.com/new-dale-chall-readability-formula.php" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Readability Formulas</a> site.</p>
<p>The table below contains scores and the corresponding grade level <strong>for Dale–Chall readability formula</strong>.</p>

<p>Originally, "difficult words" were the ones that had not been included in the word list developed by the authors of the formula. We do not know for certain, what was on that list, so we will use the so-called "Longman Communication 3000". It is a list of the 3000 most frequent words in English, based on a statistical analysis of a very large number of texts. It will be given to you as a separate file where words are divided by spaces.</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<ol>
<li>Read the text from the file.</li>
<li>Read the difficult words from another file.</li>
<li>Remove all the punctuation marks from the text.</li>
<li>Count the number of words, "difficult words", i.e., words that are not in the list, sentences, characters, syllables, and polysyllables in the text.</li>
<li>Add an option to choose the metrics to display.</li>
<li>Count the chosen scores according to the formulas above, including the new ones.</li>
<li>Count the average age.</li>
<li>Print the information in the way, shown in the examples.</li>
</ol>

Readability is the ease with which a reader can understand a written text. In natural language, the readability of text depends on its content and its presentation. Researchers have used various factors to measure readability. Readability is more than simply legibility, which is a measure of how easily a reader can distinguish individual letters or characters from each other. Higher readability eases reading effort and speed for any reader, but it is especially important for those who do not have high reading comprehension. In readers with poor reading comprehension, raising the readability level of a text from mediocre to good can make the difference between success and failure.

A compiler is a computer program that translates computer code written in one programming language into another programming language. The first language is called the source language, and the code is called source code. The second language is called the target and can usually be understood by computers. In that case, the instructions become machine code.

The text is:
A robot is a machine that can move and do certain tasks. Robots are controlled by a computer program or electronic circuitry. They may be directly controlled by humans. They may be designed to look like humans, in which case their behaviour may suggest intelligence or thought but they do not have feelings. Most robots do a specific job, and they do not always look like humans. They can come in many forms. Planet rovers are robots for exploring distant planets. Because it takes a long time to send a radio signal from Earth to another planet, the robots do much of their work alone, without commands from Earth.
