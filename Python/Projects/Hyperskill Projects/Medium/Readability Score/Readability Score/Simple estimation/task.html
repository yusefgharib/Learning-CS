<p>Have you ever wondered how to measure whether the text is hard or easy? The task is pretty simple if you're a human â€” read the text to see if you're struggling or not. However, it is a bit more complicated with computers.</p>
<p>Let's create a simple program. If a text contains more than 100 symbols (including spaces and punctuation marks) then mark this text as <code class="java">HARD</code>. If the text contains exactly 100 symbols (or less) mark it as <code class="java">EASY</code>.</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<ol>
<li>Read the text from the user input.</li>
<li>Count the symbols in the text.</li>
<li>Output the result.</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="examples">Examples</h5>
<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">&gt; This text is simple to read!

EASY                          </code></pre>
<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">&gt; This text is hard to read. It contains a lot of sentences as well as a lot of words in each sentence.

HARD                                                                                                   </code></pre></body></html>
