<html><body><h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>Our robot is a skillful player, but wouldn't it be nice if it could do other cool things? In this stage, we will add the following activities for our robopet: working, learning, and oiling. Also, let's make it all more realistic. In life, accidents happen; the same is true for our program. It is known that robots dislike water. If during working or learning the robot encountered a puddle or a swimming pool, it increases the level of rust. Oiling the robot will help get rid of rust.</p>
<p>So, first, let's add the parameter that will show us how rusty the robot got<em>. </em>The name of the parameter is <code class="java">rust</code>, the initial value is 0, and if it ever reaches 100, the robot is beyond repair. If that happens, the program should print the following message: <code class="java">{the name of the robot} is too rusty! Game over. Try again?</code>. Then, the game ends. Also, add this parameter to the <code class="java">info</code>.</p>
<p>Second, to make our Tamagotchi yet more realistic, let's edit the battery and boredom parameters in the following way:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the battery level drops to 0, the robot cannot do anything until it's recharged. If the user tries to interact with the tired robot in any other way than recharging, print <code class="java">The level of the battery is 0, {name of the robot} needs recharging!</code>.</li>
<li>If the level of boredom<em> </em>reaches 100, the robot gets depressed and cannot do anything. Print the following message motivating the user to play with the pet: <code class="java">{the name of the robot} is too bored! {the name of the robot} needs to have fun!</code>.</li>
<li>The <code class="java">info</code> command should not be blocked by the factors, mentioned above.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, let's provide the robot with opportunities to learn new skills and do some work in addition to playing. </p>
<p>Below is the list of interactions between the user and their robopet that should be implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li><code class="java">learn</code> helps the robot acquire new skills. If the level of skill is 100, print the message <code class="java">There's nothing for {name of the robot} to learn!</code>. Otherwise, learning increases the level of skill by 10, decreases the level of the battery by 10, increases the level of overheat by 10, and increases the level of boredom by 5. Print an appropriate message for the user:<br/>
<code class="java">{name of the robot}'s level of skill was {previous value}. Now it is {current value}.</code><br/>
<code class="java">{name of the robot}'s level of overheat was {previous value}. Now it is {current value}.</code><br/>
<code class="java">{name of the robot}'s level of the battery was {previous value}. Now it is {current value}.</code><br/>
<code class="java">{name of the robot}'s level of boredom was {previous value}. Now it is {current value}.</code><br/>
<code class="java">{name of the robot} has become smarter!</code></li>
<li><code class="java">work</code> is unpleasant, but you've got to do what you've got to do. If the level of skill is less than 50, print <code class="java">{name of the robot} has got to learn before working!</code>. Otherwise, working decreases the level of battery by 10, and increases the level of boredom and overheat by 10 each. It also might increase the level of rust, but it depends on unpleasant events. To reward the user and the pet, print <code class="java">{name of the robot} did well!</code>. Also, print all the changes in the robot's vitals in the following order: level of boredom, overheat, battery. If some unpleasant event took place, add the information about the event and its effect on the vitals.</li>
<li>An unpleasant event could happen during working or learning. <strong>Technically it happens at the end</strong>. One of the following events may take place: stepping into a puddle (increases the level of rust by 10), or falling into the pool (increases the level of rust by 50). The respective messages are:<br/>
<code class="java">Oh no, {name of the robot} stepped into a puddle!</code><br/>
<code class="java">Guess what! {name of the robot} fell into the pool!</code>, respectively.</li>
<li>After, print the message about the level of rust: <code class="java">{name of the robot}'s level of rust was {previous value}. Now it is {current value}.</code><br/>
	If a level of the robot's battery is less, than 10, our robot gets unattentive and falls into the pool. If a level of the robot's battery is less, than 30, and more, than 10, our robot steps into a puddle. Otherwise, our robot is perfectly attentive and nothing unpleasant can ever happen to them. </li>
<li><code class="java">play</code> is already implemented. All you have to do is add the possibility of an unpleasant event since they might take place during playing.</li>
<li>
<p><code class="java">oil</code> is the robot's medicine that helps with rust. If the rust level is zero, print <code class="java">{name of the robot} is fine, no need to oil!</code>. Otherwise, oiling decreases the rust level by 20. Print the following message after oiling:<br/>
<code class="java">{name of the robot}'s level of rust was {previous value}. Now it is {current value}. {name of the robot} is less rusty!</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, include the options <code class="java">work</code>, <code class="java"><span style="color: #000000;">learn</span></code>, and <code class="java">oil</code> in the interface. The list of available interactions will now look as follows:</p>

<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>In this stage, your program should:</p>
<ol>
<li>Offer the following interactions: oiling, learning, recharging, sleeping, playing, and working;</li>
<li>Take the user's input and call a suitable method if the input is valid;</li>
<li>Otherwise, the program should inform the user and ask for a valid input;</li>
<li>In case of an unpleasant event, the program should react to it.</li>
