  <p>As you already understood, Python has many third-party libraries for a variety of purposes. For example, natural language processing plays quite an important role among them. <a href="https://www.nltk.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">NLTK</a> is one of the main libraries for NLP purposes. </p> 
  <p>Check out the documentation of this library and its examples. Not everything may be clear to you now, but that's okay. From the options below, choose the line of code that will help you split the following sentence into words:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">sentence = """We cannot solve our problems 
with the same thinking 
we used when we created them."""</code></pre> 
  <p>The result after the operation should be the following:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-no-highlight">['We', 'can', 'not', 'solve', 'our', 'problems', 'with', 'the', 'same', 'thinking', 'we', 'used', 'when', 'we', 'created', 'them', '.']</code></pre>
