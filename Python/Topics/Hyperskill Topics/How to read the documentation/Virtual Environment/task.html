  <p>1. creates a virtual environment called <code class="java">my_venv</code> (you have Python3 installed and your current working directory is the one you want to create the environment in),<br> 2. activate it (you have Windows OS),<br> 3. install <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nltk.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">NLTK</a> library (no version specification is needed),<br> 4. deactivate the environment with the <code class="java">deactivate</code> (yes, there is nothing more to add to it) command.</p>
