  <p>Professor Moriarty is causing trouble again! Mary managed to get a file with a piece of his plan, but it's encoded. Before she could decode it, Moriarty had taken her hostage and Dr. Watson went to the rescue.</p> 
  <p>Holmes anticipated that and found a simple Caesar cipher decoder on <a target="_blank" href="https://stackoverflow.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Stack Overflow</a> to deal with it himself. Initially, the file Holmes got from Mary was called "13.txt", so he presupposed that this might be the offset <code class="language-python">n</code>. Check this theory but keep in mind that for decoding the offset has to be taken with a minus:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">def decode_Caesar_cipher(s, n):
    alpha = " ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz',.?!"
    s = s.strip()
    text = ''
    for c in s:
        text += alpha[(alpha.index(c) + n) % len(alpha)]
    print('Decoded text: "' + text + '"')</code></pre> 
  <p>Holmes, however, doesn't know how to work with files, so you must help him! You will be given the file Mary got from Moriarty's laptop. Using the code Holmes found, write a program that takes a file as an argument, reads it, decodes it, and prints the decoded text. Even though the provided piece of code above contains the phrase "Decoded text: " and quotes, please output only the decoded text itself.</p> 
  <p>If your argument <code class="language-python">--file</code> is stored in the variable <code class="language-python">args</code>, you can read the file you've passed to your script this way:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">filename = args.file
opened_file = open(filename)
encoded_text = opened_file.read()  # read the file into a string
opened_file.close()  # always close the files you've opened</code></pre>
