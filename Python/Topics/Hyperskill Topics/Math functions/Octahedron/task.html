  <p>A regular octahedron is a three-dimensional geometric shape, a polyhedron with eight equal faces and twelve equal edges. Have you ever seen 8-sided dice? That's a regular octahedron. In this task you need to calculate its area and volume.</p> 
  <p>Write a program that reads a positive integer representing the edge length of the regular octahedron and prints two values â€“ its area and volume (in that order), both <strong>rounded to 2 decimal places and split by one space</strong>.</p> 
  <p>Formula to calculate the area of an octahedron (<strong>a</strong> is edge length):</p> 
  <p><span class="math-tex">\(2*\sqrt{3} *a ^ 2\)</span></p> 
  <p>Formula to calculate the volume:</p> 
  <p><span class="math-tex">\(\frac{1}{3}*\sqrt{2}*a ^ 3\)</span></p>
