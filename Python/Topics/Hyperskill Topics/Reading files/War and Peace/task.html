  <p>Suppose you have a file that contains the entire text of "War and Peace" by Leo Tolstoy. In this file, each sentence of the novel is on a new line.</p> 
  <p>You want to write a program that preprocesses the text (e.g. splits sentences into words, and deletes punctuation marks). What is the optimal way to read this file?</p> 
  <p><button class="btn-sm btn-outline-secondary" onclick="getElementById('hint-385').style.display='inline'"> Hint </button> </p>
  <div id="hint-385" style="display:none;">
   Mind that you are likely to do several operations in each line to preprocess the novel.
