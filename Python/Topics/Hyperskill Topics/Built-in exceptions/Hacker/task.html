  <p>You are looking forward to buying a new game console, but you don't have enough money to buy it. So, you hacked the system of the shop in order to change the price of the console. Here is a part of the code. The system asks you to enter a new price in dollars. Unfortunately, you misprinted it and typed "$451". What exception type will be raised?</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">price = int(input('Enter a new price: '))  # $451
print(price)</code></pre>
