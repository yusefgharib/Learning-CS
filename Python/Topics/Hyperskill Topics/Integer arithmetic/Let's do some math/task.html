  <p>What is the result of the following Python expression?</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">print(((3 + 5) // 2 * 2 ** 3) % 7)</code></pre> 
  <p>Of course, you can easily get the answer in IDE, but we kindly ask you not to because the point of the task is for you to learn and remember the operation priority order, so, please, carefully follow the operators and try to come up with the result yourself.</p>
