<p>In this stage, we will refer to other scientific approaches to readability.</p>
<p>Take one more look at different grade levels/age brackets and corresponding scores. You can use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_readability_index" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Wikipedia article</a> on ARI. The table is suitable for all the algorithms described in this stage. To calculate the age, use <strong>the upper bound </strong>range. For example, if the range is <code class="java">12-13 year olds</code> then the upper bound is <code class="java">13 year olds</code>.</p>
<p>The first algorithm is the <strong>Flesch-Kincaid Readability Test</strong>. First, you need to create a function that calculates the number of syllables in a word. The formula is given below. You can find more information about the F-K tests in the <a href="https://readabilityformulas.com/flesch-reading-ease-readability-formula.php" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">article</a> by Readability Formulas. For calculating age, use the same table from the Automated Readability Index.</p>
<p><span class="math-tex">\(score = 0.39 * {words \over sentences} + 11.8 * {syllables \over words} - 15.59\)</span></p>
<p>The next one is the <strong>Coleman-Liau Index</strong>. The formula is given below. The age brackets you can find in the table from the previous stage. L is the average number of characters per 100 words, S is the average number of sentences per 100 words. Like with other indexes, the result is a minimum grade level required to understand this text. Polysyllables are words that have more than 2 syllables.</p>
<p><span class="math-tex">\(score = 0.0588 \ ∗ \ L−0.296 \ ∗ \ S\ −\ 15.8\)</span></p>
<p>In this stage, implement all these approaches to your program. Don't forget about the <strong>Automated Readability Index</strong>! You should also implement an option to choose all the methods at the same time.</p>
<p>To count the number of syllables, use the letters a, e, i, o, u, y as vowels. You can use these simple rules to count the syllables:</p>
<p>1. Count the number of vowels in the word.<br/>
2. Omit the so-called double vowels, that is, two vowels that follow each other. For example, "rain" has 2 vowels but only 1 syllable.<br/>
3. If a word contains 3 vowels in a row (i.e. 'notorious'), these triple vowels equal to 2 syllables.<br/>
4. Subtract the silent vowels (that is, "e" in "side" is silent, because the word ends with it, so the word has only 1 syllable).<br/>
5. If it turns out that the word contains 0 vowels, then consider this word a monosyllable.</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<ol>
<li>Read the the file named "<strong>in.txt</strong>". The file is given as a command line argument.</li>
<li>Count the number of characters, syllables, polysyllables, words, and sentences in the text.</li>
<li>Add an option to choose the metrics to display.</li>
<li>Count the chosen scores according to the formulas above.</li>
<li>Count the average age.</li>
<li>Print the information in the way, shown in the examples.</li>

A robot is a machine that can move and do certain tasks. Robots are controlled by a computer program or electronic circuitry. They may be directly controlled by humans. They may be designed to look like humans, in which case their behaviour may suggest intelligence or thought but they do not have feelings. Most robots do a specific job, and they do not always look like humans. They can come in many forms. Planet rovers are robots for exploring distant planets.
