<html><body><h5 id="description" style="text-align: center;">Description</h5>
<p>Now it is important for us to present the resulting "text" in a form that is convenient for the user.</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with HTML, here's a short explanation. When working on the previous task, you probably noticed a lot of <code class="java">&lt;div&gt;</code>, <code class="java">&lt;script&gt;</code>, or <code class="java">&lt;p&gt;</code> “words” on the displayed web page. These are called <strong>tags</strong>. Browsers need tags to know how exactly to show the page. For example, the website could include headers that look different from the rest of the text. Also, it could have links that are highlighted in blue, and the cursor could look like a pointing finger when it hovers over the link. Tags are used to help the browser identify where the links are, where an image should be, and so on.</p>
<p>Tags are necessary for the browser but aren’t useful for users. Most tags are paired. For example: <code class="java">&lt;p&gt;Some text&lt;/p&gt;</code>, where <code class="java">&lt;p&gt;</code> is an opening tag and <code class="java">&lt;/p&gt;</code> is a closing tag. Your browser should only display “<code class="java">Some text</code>”, without <code class="java">&lt;p&gt;</code> and <code class="java">&lt;/p&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Each tag has its own purpose: <code class="java">&lt;p&gt;</code> for text, <code class="java">&lt;h1&gt; &lt;h2&gt; … &lt;h6&gt;</code> for headers, <code class="java">&lt;a&gt;</code> for links, <code class="java">&lt;ul&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;</code> for lists.</p>
<p>Also, in this stage, try to make your program be able to handle incorrect URLs: for example, if an address without a dot and a top-level domain following it (for example, <span style="color: #000000;">google</span> and not <code class="java">google.com</code>) is entered, your program should output a line <code class="java">Incorrect URL</code>. Note that if you pass an incorrect URL to the method <code class="java">get()</code>, it'll throw an exception called <code class="java">requests.exceptions.ConnectionError</code>. However, if the page has already been visited, the program should be able to find it among the downloaded ones by the short name and print its content. The user also still should have an opportunity to go back to the visited pages.</p>
<h5 id="objectives" style="text-align: center;">Objectives</h5>
<p>In this stage, you need to extract and output the content between these tags. No more <code class="java">&lt;div&gt;</code>, <code class="java">&lt;script&gt;</code>, <code class="java">&lt;p&gt;</code> and so on, just a clear readable text! Your browser should display only the content (please, use <code class="java">requests.content</code> method to get the page content) of a limited list of tags (<code class="java">&lt;p&gt;</code>, headers, <code class="java">&lt;a&gt;</code> and <code class="java">&lt;ul&gt;</code>, <code class="java">&lt;ol&gt;</code>, <code class="java">&lt;li&gt;</code>) without showing the tags themselves.</p>
<p>Use the library <code class="java">beautifulsoup4</code> to make these changes. This library is already installed in your project.</p>
<p>To pass the tests, it's enough to simply <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">find the function</a> allowing us to extract the human-readable text from a web page.<strong> </strong>If you’re curious, feel free to browse through some more information about <a href="https://www.dataquest.io/blog/web-scraping-tutorial-python/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">parsing</a>!</p>
<p>When an invalid URL is entered (URL without a dot and a top-level domain name), the program should output <code class="java">Invalid URL</code>.</p>
<h5 id="example" style="text-align: center;">Example</h5>
<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>
