 <body>
  <p>Here's a list of variables:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">number_of_people_in_the_room = 10
model_score = 0.9875
client_name = "Bob"
colorOfTheShirt = "red"</code></pre> 
  <p>Some of them are named according to naming conventions and best practices, others are not.</p> 
  <p>Copy only the lines with those variables that have good names in your code. You <strong>don't</strong> need to use the <code class="language-python">print()</code> function.</p>
