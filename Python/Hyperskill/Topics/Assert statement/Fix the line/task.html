  <p>Imagine that you want to write a program that checks an email address input by a user. Now, your program is very simple: if the string contains the '@' sign, you want to return the string "<em>Done!</em>", otherwise, you should use the <code class="language-python">assert</code> keyword and output the message "<em>Try again!</em>". This procedure is implemented in the following piece of code:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">email = input()


def check_email(address):
    assert ['@' in address, 'Try again!']
    return 'Done!'


check_email(email)</code></pre> 
  <p>However, there is one syntax inaccuracy in the code. Fix the line with the incorrect syntax and enter the fixed line in the text field below.</p>
