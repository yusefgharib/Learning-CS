  <p>Below you can see a function that reads a number from input and prints some information about that number.</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">def get_number_information():
    number = int(input("Enter a number:"))
    is_even = number % 2 == 0
    squared = number ** 2
    square_root = number ** 0.5
    opposite = -number
    inverse = 1 / number
    
    print("You entered", number)
    print("Information about this number:")
    print("Even:", is_even)
    print("Square =", squared)
    print("Square root =", square_root)
    print("Opposite =", opposite)
    print("Inverse =", inverse)</code></pre> 
  <p>For the moment, all the operations we can do with our number, and all the information we can get about it is put into the single function <code class="language-python">get_number_information()</code>. This is not very convenient. </p> 
  <p>Let's instead decompose this code into several functions. We will make a <strong>separate </strong>function for <strong>each </strong>mathematical operation. </p> 
  <p>Take a look at the names of the functions below, and choose the ones that we should create. </p>
