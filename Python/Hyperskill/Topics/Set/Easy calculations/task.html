  <p>Let's suppose we have <em>13 cats</em> (and a very big house certainly), <em>3 dogs</em>, <em>2 turtles</em>, and a <em>lizard</em>. Then we decide to mix this gorgeous company up a bit and buy a <em>parrot</em>. Question: if we use Python for making a set of these pets (not their names), how many elements will the new set consist of?</p>
