  <p>The program below asks the user if they have slept enough, and suggests drinking either coffee or cocoa depending on the answer.</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">print("Have you had enough hours of sleep today?")
answer = input()
if answer == "yes":
    print("Let's drink cocoa!")
else:
    print("I'd recommend a coffee!")</code></pre> 
  <p>Now let's rewrite this if-else statement<strong> (</strong>note: do not include the first two lines of code in your answer<strong>)</strong>. It should produce the same result but in one<strong> </strong>line.</p> 
  <p>Your answer should look like this:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">print(...)</code></pre> 
  <p>where <code class="language-python">...</code> stands for the if-else statement, which does the same thing as the one presented in the example, but is written in one line. </p>
