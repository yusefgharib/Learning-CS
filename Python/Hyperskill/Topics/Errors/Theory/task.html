<h2>Errors</h2>

  <p>At this point, you probably already know that writing code sometimes might be frustrating because not everything works as you'd expect. So, in this topic, we'll finally take a look at the main reason for this frustration – errors.</p> 
  <p>The first thing you need to know about programming is how to print <code class="language-python">"Hello, world!"</code>. The second one is that this might be a challenging task, as even such a tiny script can contain various errors. Here you are:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">print("Hello, world!"</code></pre> 
  <p>If you run this code, you'll get this:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "FULL/PATH/TO_YOUR/SCRIPT.PY", line 1
    print("Hello, world!"
                        ^
SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing</code></pre> 
  <p><strong>Traceback </strong>is a stack trace that appears when your code causes an error and it reports detailed information on that particular error, indicating the <strong>specific files </strong>in which the error occurred. Nonetheless, the lines that are the most informative for us right now are the last two. They point out the mistake in your code.</p> 
  <p>This might seem a little bit frustrating, but generally, errors are designed to allow Python to communicate with you. Whenever you see those red threatening lines – don't panic! Just read carefully what they are saying.</p> 
  <h5 id="syntax-errors" style="text-align: center;">Syntax errors</h5> 
  <p>In the example above, we can clearly see the magic word <code class="language-python">SyntaxError</code> that is likely to haunt you throughout the period of getting used to Python. A large variety of different errors are referred to as syntax errors. What they usually mean is that Python has encountered a problem while trying to<strong> compile</strong> your program and it can't even execute it.</p> 
  <p>If you carefully read the text of a traceback, it will help you to find mistakes and correct them quite easily, as you can see an<strong> arrow</strong> pointing to the exact place where Python found the mistake in your code. Every syntax error has an <strong>associated value</strong>.<strong> </strong>It describes an error in detail. In the example, "<samp>EOF</samp>" in the message <samp>"SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing"</samp> stands for the end of a file. This message means that something else had been expected after your statement, but you didn't pass it to the interpreter. In our case, there should've been a closing round bracket <samp>")"</samp>.</p> 
  <p>Mistakes won't be so obvious all the time. It is quite likely that the message you'll get as an associated value will be the most common and obscure <samp>"invalid syntax"</samp>, which isn't really helpful. Well, anyway, to locate the problem it’s enough to know that the error is in the syntax.</p> 
  <h5 id="common-errors-for-beginners" style="text-align: center;">Common errors for beginners</h5> 
  <p>Some of the most common syntax errors are:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>wrong spelling</strong> of keywords and function names, e.g. <code class="language-python">While</code> instead of <code class="language-python">while</code>, <code class="language-python">pint</code> instead of <code class="language-python">print</code>;</li> 
   <li>the wrong number of <strong>parentheses </strong>in function calls, e.g. <code class="language-python">print "just one round bracket")</code>;</li> 
   <li><strong>indents </strong>are also the fertile soil for errors, therefore, use spaces and tabs carefully;</li> 
   <li><strong>quotes</strong>. Don’t forget to wrap a string in quotes of the same type: triple quotes for multi-line strings, double or single quotes for ordinary strings.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>Modern IDEs tend to check everything for you and kindly highlight the places where you have made a mistake or typo, but don't rely on this too much and be ready to read the traceback yourself.</p> 
  <p></p>
  <div class="alert alert-warning">
   Mind that Python stops compiling your program after finding
   <strong> </strong>the
   <strong> first</strong> Syntax error, so it might take a while to fix every single mistake.
  </div>
  <p></p> 
  <p>Check the following piece of code, for example. It looks like a Petri dish of syntax errors:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">missing_quote  = "this is a mistake!
another_string = this is not a string!"
parted_string = 'I'd like to be highlighted, but'
          prnit("I am not")</code></pre> 
  <p>As you can see, there are plenty of syntax errors in this tiny piece of code. If you’ve checked and corrected everything from the list above and yet you encounter those error messages – don’t worry! Once again, it’s just Python trying to tell you that something went wrong. Take a deep breath, reread the article, and continue perfecting your programming skills!</p>
