  <p>A Python student is trying to write a program that gets two numbers from the user and prints the sum of those numbers. Unfortunately, something is wrong with the code and it doesn't work as expected:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">first_number = input()
second_number = input()

print(first_number + second_number)</code></pre> 
  <p>How should the last line be changed? Write your suggestion below.</p> 
  <p>Mind that you should change and rewrite only <strong>the last line</strong>. Write it in the box below. </p>
