<h2>When you'll have a free trip?</h2>

 <head></head>
 <body>
  <p>An airline company "Happy travel" has a loyalty system for its customers: for each dollar spent, they get 0.01 free miles on their account, which they can use later to travel for free. Below is the code for free air miles calculation for one customer who plans to travel from London to Paris and back:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python"># the number of free miles per dollar
n_miles = 0.01

# money spent per month (in dollars)
money = 2000

# number of miles earned each month
miles_per_month = money * n_miles

# distance from London to Paris and back (in miles)
total_distance = 215 * 2</code></pre> 
  <p>What would be the correct final line to calculate how many months it will take for this client to make the desired trip free of charge?</p>
