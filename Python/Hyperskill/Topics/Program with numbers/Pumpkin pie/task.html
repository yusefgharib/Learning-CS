  <p>Paul has baked a pumpkin pie and asked his guests how many pieces they wanted to take home:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">n_pieces = int(input("How many pieces of the pumpkin pie can I offer you?"))</code></pre> 
  <p>It's so nice of him! However, this program crashed as one guest entered the value <code class="language-python">2.5</code>. What are possible actions to prevent the error in the code? There is more than just one correct answer.</p> 
  <p>Let's assume that no guest should leave without a treat! You also don't have to think about cases when a guest enters something different than a number in this task. Also, keep in mind that, in programming, it's rather naive to hope that the users will always follow the rules and do exactly what they are told.</p>
