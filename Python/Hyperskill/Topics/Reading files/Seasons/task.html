  <p>There's a file <strong>seasons.txt</strong> that looks like this:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Spring
Summer
Autumn
Winter</code></pre> 
  <p>We implemented the following code:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">seasons_file = open('seasons.txt', 'r', encoding='utf-8')

seasons = seasons_file.readlines()
favorite_season = seasons[2]

seasons_file.close()</code></pre> 
  <p>What will be the value of the variable <code class="language-python">favorite_season</code>? Write it below without quotation marks. Remember that the default newline character is <code class="language-python">'\n'</code>.</p>
